## To Build and Run
Ruby, bundler, npm/yarn, postgresql is required to be installed first.

4 Redis server is required to be installed and running to enable caching function.

### Build Frontend
```
bundle install
rake db:create db:migrate
cd client
npm install
npm run build
```
### Run
```
ruby app.rb
```

### Test
```
rake test
```

## Architecture:
* The frontend of NanoTwitter is built with React.js to present a modern UI and allow AJAX requests. 
* The backend of NanoTwitter is built with Sinatra, which is running on a Puma server. The application is deployed on Heroku and uses PgSQL as database and includes multiple redis addon for cache. 
* For the three major requests (timeline, search and post tweet), the application will only hit the database if there is a cache miss. The data retrieved from data base will be cached in corresponding redis server until itâ€™s expired or invalidated by other APIs.


## Deployment:
The project is hooked to [Codeship](https://app.codeship.com/projects/329361) and deployed on [Heroku](https://nano-twitter-sits.herokuapp.com/).

## Documentations:
* [Route](/doc/ROUTE.md)
